# Walmart Social Analytics
 
<h4>Task:</h4>

Trends come and go as demand peaks and falls — there is no purpose to stocking up on a product that currently has no demand in the market. If a trend is catching on in one part of the city, a smart idea would be to move inventories there and peg the demand immediately. And when the trend shifts again, move the inventory once more. The task is to leverage social trends to optimize store inventory.
You can also generate your dataset from the Twitter stream by searching for a few specific products by using the Twitter API. The  dataset should contain tweets relevant to mobile phones (i.e. search for phone-specific tweets). Specifically, consider trends for three specific brands:
- Apple (iPhone)
- Samsung
- OnePlus

<h4>Approach:</h4>

- Use Tweepy, a twitter API to obtain tweets and filter them based on the phone and location.
- Perform sentiment analysis and classify them into positive or negative tweets. Negative tweets do not imapact the solution.
- Use Power BI to gain insights and include it's API in the web application. 
- Schedule functions to run in real time and host the web application.
